<h2>Using i3 on a old laptop</h2>
<h5>02/15/2024</h5>
<p>On a old Dell laptop I have Fedora installed and usually I use GNOME but I also have i3.</p>
<p>I love i3. I wish I had it on another computer as I love just having three workspaces and just need something that is fast. They are usually Firefox, Terminal/Alacrity with Neovim/SSH/TMUX and the third workspace is a mix of terminal and browser. I really enjoy i3 and wish I had it on my work computer as its windows and it gets in the way of me being productive. Some other reasons I like i3:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Helps me focus as I kinda mono tast more on each workspaces</li> 
 <li>Helps me learn something new and makes me feel better as I have improved workflows.</li>
 <li>The minimum OS gives me better battery levels and keeps my laptop running cool and quiet.</li>
</ul>
<p>So for various reasons, I want to get better at i3 and I will always come back to using it in the future.</p>

<h2>Trying out text editor shells on Mac</h2>
<h5>02/11/2024</h5>
<p>Currently using Alacritty but did try out Warp, but it had to much unused space. I usually use iTerm as my regular Terminal app broke with my NeoVim font settings.</p>
<p>Want to have a low power terminal, and be able to try something new. So far I am liking Warp.</p>
<p>With Warp, I also found that I didnt need all the features as all you really need to know is TMUX.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Getting back to my online courses</h2>
<h5>02/10/2024</h5>
<p>Been busy with work so that in the evening I don't have energy to study my online courses. I am finally getting back to online learning after taking about 7 days off.</p>
<p>Doing the SQL and Tableau courses are shorter so I really need to study hard to finish them both.</p>  
<p>I go back to Python on Boot.Dev to keep my coding knowledge stills fresh but I do miss Go on Coursera, as I want to make my website with Go. I also miss CS50, which is a hard course, but I think I will be ready epically after Boot.Dev.</p>
<p>I think to help me study more, I want either a MacBook Air or a System76 laptop with Linux, preferably Debian. I want something light and fast, and I don't want a kickstand like on a Surface Pro.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Make more time for learning and hobbies</h2>
<h5>2/3/2024</h5>
<p>I think having a part time job would be best way to make time for learning and side projects. I have never had a part time job, so that will be weird. Finding motivation right now is kinda hard with a fill like job that has FTO as i cant control things breaking or projects.</p>
<p>I was thinking of barista but i wouldn't mind having a outdoor job working with plants or some kind sustainable construction job. Also have been thinking of Europe and where to get a job and live and to be honest, i think Colorado has just as much as those other places except a ocean.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Hyperloop on Twitter and getting around to goals</h2>
<h5>1/31/2024</h5>
<p>After not having Twitter on my phone for months, I finally logged in to see what Hyperloop groups were still active. Unsurprisingly many of the European groups were still tweeting, and much fud was being said in the #hyperloop search.</p>
<p>I would like to do a video again soon but I am not sure I have time.</p>
<p>It takes time to write a scrip and I just dont have the energy.</p>
<p>So I was thinking of doing the livestream of building passenger rail in Colorado in City Skylines and also speaking about hyperloop. Or I use a mod from citywokcitywalls assets on Steam Workshop.</p>
<p>So the crux of it is finding motivation, and then setting aside time. Its hard to keep the alignment of work not crossing the path of my goals in life as well as hobbies and exercise.</p>
<p>I do like envisioning a hyperloop but I do want to see it actually built, just like I want to spend more time doing things that give me meaning.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Transportation advocacy + Video Games + Coding</h2>
<h5>1/21/2024</h5>
<p>
I was in the pool and thinking of how I can combine many different hobbies and learn how to code. So I came up with a project:
<ul>
  <li>Online and free</li>
  <li>Similar to Oregon Trail, as it will be pixel based and have story lines for the choices you make.</li>
  <li>Take donations and be able to sell merch</li>
  <li>Will help me learn to code</li>
  <li>Be able to do some public advocacy for sustainable transportation for Colorado.</li>
  <li>Might allow me to do it full time and be able to travel as I can interview people, be my own boss, and allow me to do something I am passionate about.</li>
  <li>Will allow me to do more YouTube stuff like live streams and edited clips.</li>
</ul>
I had previously written about my goal for an open source app for myself but I think this one project has more possible benefits:
<ul>
  <li>Be able to put all my learnings of Go, SQL, Python and cloud hosing into action</li>
  <li>Contribute to <s>open source</s> my own project and manage <s>open source</s> my own project</li>
  <li>Gain project management skills</li>
  <li>Sell add-ons or other features as a way to earn money. Advertise services from vendors or consultants.</li>
  <li>Offer a tip jar or way for support/payment</li>
</ul>
Also, after doing a bit of research, I could use <a link href="https://renpy.org">Ren'Py</a> to get story lines set up and then code it to include a map and rel time visualization of trains. I am just really excited to be able to have one project that interests me on so many levels. I was also listening <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nz8GXjxiHg&t=12949s">to this video on how to get a developer job</a> and clearly having one big project that is worked on with fully is better than many projects.

<h2>Learning Online Costs and Time Commitment</h2>
<h5>1/18/2024</h5>
<p>I thought I would just write down how much time and money I have spent for continuing education and professional development.</p>
<ul>
  <li>$349.00 for a lab simulator for Network+ <a href="https://w3.testout.com/courseware/network-pro">TestOut</a> and I have not completed it for over a year.</li>
  <li>$434.15 each year for 2+ years for Coursera Plus for <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/EAD8CGS7VDSN">Google Project Management</a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/SG9QTL4PHP8B">Google IT Support</a></li>
  <li>Free access to Pluralsight via my work which took me around 3 months: Network Security Basics, VLAN Operation and Con figuration, Network Troubleshooting and Tools, Ethernet Operation and Switch Configuration, Network Management and Operations, Introduction Enterprise Network Infrastructure, Network Concepts and Protocols</li>
  <li>Over $600 on other miscellaneous educational stuff over the last three years.</li>
</ul>
<p>I failed to schedule and take the Network+ exam last year, I knew I would fail it. It really does require alot of real-world networking/hardware experience. I think the hardest thing about the Network+ was getting motivation to use my knowledge to create a home lab to practice what I was learning. </p>
<p>I also underestimated how much time Network+ study would take when it was not part of my daily work experience.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if I were to look into a physical or live/online class for Network+ certification, I would 100% start building a physical homelab to put what I am learning to work.</p>
<p>Right now I am using Coursera to do other courses in my spare time at night and on weekends for continuing education to get baseline certificates that expand my skills. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data Visualization with Tableau Specialization</li>
  <li>Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate</li>
  <li>Google Business Intelligence Professional Certificate</li>
  <li>Learn SQL Basics for Data Science Specialization</li>
  <li>Programming with Google Go Specialization</li>
  <li>Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate</li>
</ul>

<h2>Physical Keyboard</h2>
<h5>1/14/2024</h5>
<p>Its hard re-learning how to type on a new Kenesis Advantage 2 QD keyboard. However, its much better on my wrists. But I will try and keep using it every day. My first thought when taking notes is how much I have to look down at my fingers and then how I am using my fingers to type with the incorrect finger per key. Always overwhelming learning new things but glad I am doing it.</p>
<p>Now just making git to wrap all my commands of `G add .`, `G commit -m "message I am typing out"`, `git push` into one command.</p>
<hr>
<h2>UX in online courses</h2>
<h5>1/12/2024</h5>
<p>I am in Coursera most of the time for online courses and I have a few recommendations on how they could make finishing courses better for users like me.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make a dark mode. None of the website can be toggled to eye friendly dark mode and this is a huge as we are putting a ton of screentime into watching their videos and takeing exams in front of white sreen that is painful.</li>
  <li>Improve the iPad app. It is impossible to view all the courses I am enrolled in on the iPad. There is a bug where it just shows lines where the courses are and you have to scroll to the bottom and then scroll back to the top to make the courses show up.</li>
  <li>Courses are a mess. You have to click around alot to get into and out of units and modules.</li>
  <li>Embed a text to speech engin! Yes the AI help bot is great but stop delaying a TTS AI bot to help!</li>
  <li>Note taking app. Having a embeded note taking app within the website would be awesome.</li>
  <li>Follow what Khan Academy is doing and make it more playful.</li>
  <li>I also wish my portfolio submissions could also be viewed just as my Certificates are viewable.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are some of my gripes but I love taking courses on Coursera (its better than edX with the breath of subjects) but some of the above UX changes would be a huge help.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Open Source App Idea</h2>
<h5>1/8/2024</h5>
<p>
The idea is to make a app that can be used on a phone where it will track door lock installs. Features:
<ul>
  <li>Connect to a API for hardware components etc</li>
  <li>Be able to export to CSV or spreadsheet</li>
  <li>Take photos and save media</li>
  <li>Real time CRUD database</li>
  <li>Drop pins on a blueprint overlay</li>
  <li>Be able to add other data like access control for groups etc</li>
  <li>Project track site survey, fabrication, change orders, show a visual timeline, install and track completion tasks.</li>
</ul>
Goal of the app for myself:
<ul>
  <li>Be able to put all my learnings of Go, SQL and cloud hosing into action</li>
  <li>Contribute to open source and manage a open source project</li>
  <li>Gain project management skills</li>
  <li>Sell addons or other features as a way to earn money. Advertise servieces from venders or consulants.</li>
  <li>Offer a tip jar or way for support/payment</li>
</ul>

<h2>40 Marathons before 40</h2>
<h5>1/6/2024</h5>
<p>
Another blog post about exercise, but this one is a big goal.
40 Marathons before I am 40. 
I am not 100% sure how many marathons I have run so far, will need to recount. However, I think this goal will be great as it will give a bunch of strucutre, and will be a great way to do perhaps other marathons in other contries.
Also a great excuse to travel. 
<hr>
<h2>Swimming</h2>
<h5>1/3/2024</h5>
<p>
The blog post title was going to be exercise but I want to talk more about swimming in particular. I want to talk about being in the pool for a couple of reasons. 
<ul>
  <li>Swimming gives you gains. It makes you really buff without having to lift weights.</li>
  <li>Its basially like yoga and afterwards I think it makes you feel just as relaxed.</li>
  <li>The pool is very rairly busy, so its super easy to get in and do the 1500 meters and then get out.</li>
</ul>
I am just so glad I learned how to swim and think I will continue to do it for a very long time.
<br>
<hr>
<h2>2024</h2>
<h5>1/1/2024</h5>
<p>
Some goals for 2024 from the top of my mind:
<ol>
 <li>Run more, or even every day, including more marathons</li> 
 <li>Learn bagpipes</li>
 <li>Finish more of my certificates</li>
 <li>Continue to get better at Neovim and submit to Github almost every day</li>
 <li>Travel more and do projects when I travel like straw bale projectes</li>
 <li>Cook more</li>
 <li>Wear more sunscreen</li>
</ol>
<p>
Who knows how these goals will go over time but i feel like my goals in life are becoming more focused and are more fun to accomplish.
<p>
Basically the goal for 2024 is to do things that I would like to do.

<h2>Unexpected AI</h2>
<h5>12/27/2023</h5>
<p>
While choosing what to study tonight, I decided to go back to learning Python and Go on Boot.Dev. Its been some weeks since I last did a bit of python, so I was trying to remember how to do things and was asked a tricky question on one of the code challenges.
<p>
Instead of just clicking hint, I decided to use the AI chat bot "boots" for the first time ever. Three things stood out to me.
<p>
<ol>
  <li>My first question was asking for a hint. "Can you give me a hint on this assignment." This was helpful but I was still confused so I asked for another hint. This time it responded with contextual hint regarding what was in the code. After four attempts, I finally gave Boots a correct answer to a specific question from the initial hint. It was patient and gave me confidence.</li>
  <li>I felt like it was a person siting right next to me. I have never felt this supported writing code and learning from my mistakes. This was a first in my entire 10+ years of trying to learn code.</li>
  <li>After I was walked though the question and I finally came to the correct answer, I thanked the AI for the help and said that I didn't feel so dumb. With that it replied: "You're very welcome! But remember, asking questions doesn't make you dumb, it makes you a dedicated student. Learning includes asking, stumbling, and growing, it's all part of the journey. Feel free to return anytime you need help or even if you just want to chat about coding, salmon, or magical spells. Keep up your awesome work!" I felt seen.</li>
</ol>
<p>
This one interaction with an AI made me feel so good. I am so happy to not have shame relying on a AI when learning how to write python.

<h2>Video games and self-study</h2>
<h5>12/26/2023</h5>
<p>
I think about Video Games a lot. I also play alot. From Civ to City Skylines to my latest favorite, Starfield. I like thinking during the day about what I want to build or do when later in the evening I get to play. 
<p>
On the flip coin, I also think about what I want to study or learn about in the evening. I signed up for even more courses last night. Mainly about business analysis and hospitality courses. 
<p>
For some reason, both this ways to spend time is fun for me. In reading "The Daily Stoic", he has a hole chapter about titled "Education is Freedom," and to that I would add it is also calming. Calming in that I don't feel scared while encountering new experiences or huge projects. Education really does make you more freeier. 
<p>

<h2>Workouts and Goals </h2>
<h5>12/16/2023</h5>
<p>
This has been a busy week of work, so on Friday I went out of my way to go to the pool and swim just a bit, and on Saturday I went again with the goal of going really far.
<p>
Back in 2018 did a challenge with my triathlon club to do either 10k or 5k distance swim at the end of the new year. After completing the 5k challenge in the cold DAC pool, I really felt accomplished.
<p> 
Just like doing long distance run challenges over multiple days, I thought the epic goal of a long swim would be great for a change and a way to end the year. So on Saturday, I started the swim with the goal of just 3k, then I upped it to 4k, and then to 5k. It was not easy, but going slowly was a good idea. After almost 2 hours of swimming I hit the 5k. 
<p>
Things i learned. Always good to use the bathroom. Just take breaks and do it so you can feel refreshed and ready to do another 2k. Another thing I learned is just take the risk and try and do it. Its such a shame if you don't try and me just going slow was exactly what I needed to get it down. Finally, i didn't expect to see it, but it was snowing hard, and the cool down I did at the end on my back looking up to the sky. I can only say that seeing the snowflakes into infinity was really cool. It looked like stars in the sky. Any having playing the game Starfield, it really was a starfield of flakes. 
<p>
So just go for it. Whether the goal is big or small, if you have energy and interest, go for your goals.
<p>

<h2>Data Vis, Hyperloop and Bumper Stickers</h2>
<h5>12/16/2023</h5>
<p>
Learning data vis in Tableau right now. I wish I had learned this earlier in my work as I think I could have used it.
<p>
I still keep thinking of my goal to make some kind of website or game where you can see hyperloop pods going around their tracks. When I am learning Tableau I am using data from the Global Hyperloop Challenge where I pitched 'Colorado Hyperloop.'
<p>
After my support of something very futuristic, I am wanting to create merch and bumper stickers that promote a Front Range Passenger Rail in Colorado. Perhaps learning how to visualize data will let me figure out cleaver ways to advocate for the train. 
<p>
The goal for the next year is to create a merch store. Some of my favorite things were a poster of all the routes, a bumper sticker with the word "hyperloop", and t-Shirt that had the same "Hyperlop" and a Global Challenge T-shirt. 
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Work Goals</h2>
<h5>12/13/2023</h5>
<p>
I have three short term work goals that I either do at night or work on when I dont have other things to do at work:
<ol type="I">
  <li> Study the Data Analystics course by Google and copy down the job post I read about it to then get those skills.</li>
  <li> Create the project management template for initial conversations with stakeholders about projects with Hospitality IT.</li>
  <li> Figure out a project with Sustainability staff that would augment my development of a leadership skill.</li>
</ol>
<p> 
I find having these goals as comforting as it gives me goals to attain and gives me confidence in knowing that I am learning new things. 
<p>
However, I am working in other online courses at the same time, by learning about Python, Go, Tableau/Data visualization, SQL and other skills like Buseiness Presentations and hopefully converting this blog and website to Django or Go in the future. 
<p>
I also forgot about CS50W... which I would love to finish and get a certifacte. 
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Self study to get jobs<h2>
<h5>12/10/2023</h5>
<p>
In writing this blog, I cant stop thinking about all the past jobs and personal study and sacrifice it took to get here. I see my Github history and I can see the first commits were Oct 31, 2011. I had no idea what I was doing, but I was in a bootcamp trying to will myself to learn. 
<p>
I think the main lesson is that its taken me 12 years to get where I am now. I never formally studied code, and have spent a small fortune on TeamTreehouse, Corsera, EdX and other platforms like boot.dev to level up my skills. Basically it got me to do freelance work with WordPress,  move over to CRMS's, get a support job, and then become a IT Analyst.
<p>
I am still proud of customizing a template from Teamtreehouse and then releasing my own Android app Dec 5, 2014
<p>
I was listening to a podcast and in the discussion I learned that its not the goal that you should be excited about, but rather the journey there. So my journey for over 10 years has been trying to learn code. Maybe one day I will get there, but I think that the journey there will be the destination.  
<p>
<hr>
<h2>New way to learn to code, break it</h2>
<h5>12/3/2023</h5>
<p>
I have spent so many years trying to learn to code, so I am going to try and learn by not having any fear on getting a project, then write code or get code from the example, then try and break it. I should not be taking notes anymore, but rather get muscle memory in interacting with code more. So will I take hints on writing code? Yes. But I will try and break it more often to see how it works. 
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Learning goals</h2>
<h5>11/27/2023</h5>
<p>
I think my goals for the Data Analyst courses is just to make more templates. When people have ideas, or I have an idea, I need a way to show how those ideas, goals or projects can come together visually so everyone can see risks, goals and the end result. Stopping and thinking about projects is always a good idea. So I hope these templates can help me at work better. 
<p>

<h2>My workflow for taking notes on multiple devices</h2>
<h5>11/26/2023</h5>
<p>
Below is a half written vlog post on how it has taken me 5 years to hone in on how to take notes from online courses as well as learn tools and technology.  
<p>
1. I was working for a domain name company and one of the senior engineers recommended that I learn Vim.This got me down the rabbit hole of learning how to interact with a computer applications only by using the keyboard. As a way to learn I found the YouTube channel ThePrimeagen where he showed how to configure his Vimrc config file. This is where I then learned of Neovim and then I learned via his YouTube videos of TJ's Kickstart repo of easy way to get Neovim workable fast for my level of knowledge. 
<p>
2. I enrolled in multiple Coursera courses including the non-credited professional certificates of "IT Support by Google" and the "Project Management" course by Google. The one issue is that I would take these courses at home, the library, during the day in my spare time and at coworking spaces. I had a big and heavy mac laptop with iTerm, so I started to use my dads old surface pro with WSL Ubantu, then a old windows computer which I put Fedora on and most recently a iPad with Termius. Since I had continued to watch ThePrimagine, I learned that he uses Github to store his SSH credentials so when he changes computer he pulls his data from the cloud so its not a pain in the butt to redo all the SSH credentials. So I thought that instated of using Google Docs, I should start commit directly to Github for my notes. This also helped me learn Git and Github commands better. But there was one issue, I had different versions of Neovim on all my computers and tablets, and it was starting to get frustrating how all my folders were in different locations on all my devices. Thus, I started to learn about cloud Virtual Private Services. After seeing so many Linux content creators sponsored by Linode,  now Akamai Linodes, and after alot of hesitation I went with the cheapest Nanode 1 GB with Debian. I am super happy. 
<p>
3. The last tool that I cant imaging being without is TMUX. When I SSH into my Linode VPS, I immediately type out TMUX which gives me the ability to easily create, tile and organize my main NVIM session, but also quickly navigate and create new files and run code files that I write when I take notes in other online courses. For example I am taking notes in Markdown files for Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, but I sometimes switch other courses I am taking for a change of pace and a motivational treat. These include "Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate", "Programming with Google Go Specialization", or I resume my EdX course "CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript".
<p>
4. Right now I don't know what else I will do with future tools as I am pretty happy with my journey so far, but the most recent one I am trying to get better with is a new ergonomic keyboard "Advantage2" from Kinesis. I am painfully slow right now but again its a long term skill I want to gain, and relieve some of the pain of writing on hard laptop and squishy surfaces pro's keyboards.
