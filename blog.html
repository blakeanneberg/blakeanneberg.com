<h2>Unexpected AI</h2>
<h5>12/27/2023</h5>
<p>
While choosing what to study tonight, I decided to go back to learning Python and Go on Boot.Dev. Its been some weeks since I last did a bit of python, so I was trying to remember how to do things and was asked a tricky question on one of the code challanges.
<p>
Instead of just clicking hint, I decided to use the AI chat bot "boots" for the first time ever. Three things stood out to me.
<p>
<ol>
  <li>My first question was askign for a hint. "Can you give me a hint on this assignment." This was helpfull but I was still confused so I asked for another hint. This time it responded with contextual hint regarding what was in the code. After four attempts, I finally gave Boots a correct answer to a specific question from the initial hint. It was patient and gave me confidence</li>
  <li>I felt like it was a person siting right next to me. I have never felt this supported writing code and learning from my mistakes.</li>
  <li>I thanked the AI for the help and said that I didnt feel so dumb. With that it replied: "You're very welcome! But remember, asking questions doesn't make you dumb, it makes you a dedicated student. Learning includes asking, stumbling, and growing, it's all part of the journey. Feel free to return anytime you need help or even if you just want to chat about coding, salmon, or magical spells. Keep up your awesome work!"</li>
</ol>
<p>
This one interaction with an AI made me feel so good. I am so happy to not have shame reliying on a AI when learning how to write python.

<h2>Video games and self-study</h2>
<h5>12/26/2023</h5>
<p>
I think about Video Games a lot. I also play alot. From Civ to City Skylines to my latest favorite, Starfield. I like thinking during the day about what I want to build or do when later in the evening I get to play. 
<p>
On the flip coin, I also think about what I want to study or learn about in the evening. I signed up for even more courses last night. Mainly about business analysis and hospitality courses. 
<p>
For some reason, both this ways to spend time is fun for me. In reading "The Daily Stoic", he has a hole chapter about titled "Education is Freedom," and to that I would add it is also calming. Calming in that I don't feel scared while encountering new experiences or huge projects. Education really does make you more freeier.

<h2>Workouts and Goals </h2>
<h5>12/16/2023</h5>
<p>
This has been a busy week of work, so on Friday I went out of my way to go to the pool and swim just a bit, and on Saturday I went again with the goal of going really far.
<p>
Back in 2018 did a challenge with my triathlon club to do either 10k or 5k distance swim at the end of the new year. After completing the 5k challenge in the cold DAC pool, I really felt accomplished.
<p> 
Just like doing long distance run challenges over multiple days, I thought the epic goal of a long swim would be great for a change and a way to end the year. So on Saturday, I started the swim with the goal of just 3k, then I upped it to 4k, and then to 5k. It was not easy, but going slowly was a good idea. After almost 2 hours of swimming I hit the 5k. 
<p>
Things i learned. Always good to use the bathroom. Just take breaks and do it so you can feel refreshed and ready to do another 2k. Another thing I learned is just take the risk and try and do it. Its such a shame if you don't try and me just going slow was exactly what I needed to get it down. Finally, i didn't expect to see it, but it was snowing hard, and the cool down I did at the end on my back looking up to the sky. I can only say that seeing the snowflakes into infinity was really cool. It looked like stars in the sky. Any having playing the game Starfield, it really was a starfield of flakes. 
<p>
So just go for it. Whether the goal is big or small, if you have energy and interest, go for your goals.

<h2>Data Vis, Hyperloop and Bumper Stickers</h2>
<h5>12/16/2023</h5>
<p>
Learning data vis in Tableau right now. I wish I had learned this earlier in my work as I think I could have used it.
<p>
I still keep thinking of my goal to make some kind of website or game where you can see hyperloop pods going around their tracks. When I am learning Tableau I am using data from the Global Hyperloop Challenge where I pitched 'Colorado Hyperloop.'
<p>
After my support of something very futuristic, I am wanting to create merch and bumper stickers that promote a Front Range Passenger Rail in Colorado. Perhaps learning how to visualize data will let me figure out cleaver ways to advocate for the train. 
<p>
The goal for the next year is to create a merch store. Some of my favorite things were a poster of all the routes, a bumper sticker with the word "hyperloop", and t-Shirt that had the same "Hyperlop" and a Global Challenge T-shirt. 
<p>

<h2>Work Goals</h2>
<h5>12/13/2023</h5>
<p>
I have three short term work goals that I either do at night or work on when I dont have other things to do at work:
<ol type="I">
  <li> Study the Data Analystics course by Google and copy down the job post I read about it to then get those skills.</li>
  <li> Create the project management template for initial conversations with stakeholders about projects with Hospitality IT.</li>
  <li> Figure out a project with Sustainability staff that would augment my development of a leadership skill.</li>
</ol>
<p> 
I find having these goals as comforting as it gives me goals to attain and gives me confidence in knowing that I am learning new things. 
<p>
However, I am working in other online courses at the same time, by learning about Python, Go, Tableau/Data visualization, SQL and other skills like Buseiness Presentations and hopefully converting this blog and website to Django or Go in the future. 
<p>
I also forgot about CS50W... which I would love to finish and get a certifacte.

<h2>Self study to get jobs<h2>
<h5>12/10/2023</h5>
<p>
In writing this blog, I cant stop thinking about all the past jobs and personal study and sacrifice it took to get here. I see my Github history and I can see the first commits were Oct 31, 2011. I had no idea what I was doing, but I was in a bootcamp trying to will myself to learn. 
<p>
I think the main lesson is that its taken me 12 years to get where I am now. I never formally studied code, and have spent a small fortune on TeamTreehouse, Corsera, EdX and other platforms like boot.dev to level up my skills. Basically it got me to do freelance work with WordPress,  move over to CRMS's, get a support job, and then become a IT Analyst.
<p>
I am still proud of customizing a template from Teamtreehouse and then releasing my own Android app Dec 5, 2014
<p>
I was listening to a podcast and in the discussion I learned that its not the goal that you should be excited about, but rather the journey there. So my journey for over 10 years has been trying to learn code. Maybe one day I will get there, but I think that the journey there will be the destination.

<h2>New way to learn to code, break it</h2>
<h5>12/3/2023</h5>
<p>
I have spent so many years trying to learn to code, so I am going to try and learn by not having any fear on getting a project, then write code or get code from the example, then try and break it. I should not be taking notes anymore, but rather get muscle memory in interacting with code more. So will I take hints on writing code? Yes. But I will try and break it more often to see how it works. 
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Learning goals</h2>
<h5>11/27/2023</h5>
<p>
I think my goals for the Data Analyst courses is just to make more templates. When people have ideas, or I have an idea, I need a way to show how those ideas, goals or projects can come together visually so everyone can see risks, goals and the end result. Stopping and thinking about projects is always a good idea. So I hope these templates can help me at work better.

<h2>My workflow for taking notes on multiple devices</h2>
<h5>11/26/2023</h5>
<p>
Below is a half written vlog post on how it has taken me 5 years to hone in on how to take notes from online courses as well as learn tools and technology.  
<p>
1. I was working for a domain name company and one of the senior engineers recommended that I learn Vim.This got me down the rabbit hole of learning how to interact with a computer applications only by using the keyboard. As a way to learn I found the YouTube channel ThePrimeagen where he showed how to configure his Vimrc config file. This is where I then learned of Neovim and then I learned via his YouTube videos of TJ's Kickstart repo of easy way to get Neovim workable fast for my level of knowledge. 
<p>
2. I enrolled in multiple Coursera courses including the non-credited professional certificates of "IT Support by Google" and the "Project Management" course by Google. The one issue is that I would take these courses at home, the library, during the day in my spare time and at coworking spaces. I had a big and heavy mac laptop with iTerm, so I started to use my dads old surface pro with WSL Ubantu, then a old windows computer which I put Fedora on and most recently a iPad with Termius. Since I had continued to watch ThePrimagine, I learned that he uses Github to store his SSH credentials so when he changes computer he pulls his data from the cloud so its not a pain in the butt to redo all the SSH credentials. So I thought that instated of using Google Docs, I should start commit directly to Github for my notes. This also helped me learn Git and Github commands better. But there was one issue, I had different versions of Neovim on all my computers and tablets, and it was starting to get frustrating how all my folders were in different locations on all my devices. Thus, I started to learn about cloud Virtual Private Services. After seeing so many Linux content creators sponsored by Linode,  now Akamai Linodes, and after alot of hesitation I went with the cheapest Nanode 1 GB with Debian. I am super happy. 
<p>
3. The last tool that I cant imaging being without is TMUX. When I SSH into my Linode VPS, I immediately type out TMUX which gives me the ability to easily create, tile and organize my main NVIM session, but also quickly navigate and create new files and run code files that I write when I take notes in other online courses. For example I am taking notes in Markdown files for Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, but I sometimes switch other courses I am taking for a change of pace and a motivational treat. These include "Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate", "Programming with Google Go Specialization", or I resume my EdX course "CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript".
<p>
4. Right now I don't know what else I will do with future tools as I am pretty happy with my journey so far, but the most recent one I am trying to get better with is a new ergonomic keyboard "Advantage2" from Kinesis. I am painfully slow right now but again its a long term skill I want to gain, and relieve some of the pain of writing on hard laptop and squishy surfaces pro's keyboards.
